 * Private visibility is great to maintain internal structure of you classess
 * as developer, you can change the internal structure without affecting the external code(for example other classes that
 * extends it -coming later) that uses it
 * So how do we read or change these private properties or methods from outside or other classes
 * We can do so using getter and setters
 * These methods are also known as accessor
