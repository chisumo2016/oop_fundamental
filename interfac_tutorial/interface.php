/**
 * An interfac_tutorial is an OOP element that groups a set of function declarationss without implementing them
 *
 * Interfaces are different from abtsract class,since they can not contain any implementaion at all whereas classes could mix both method
 * definitions and imeplemented ones
 * e
 * interfac_tutorial cannot containe any properties of  functions so lets move code from customer to person class leaving only this left in
 *
 *Form developers point of view , using a class that implements an interfac_tutorial is like write a contract:
 *
 *You ensure that your class will always have the methods  declared in the interfac_tutorial , regardless of them implementation.
