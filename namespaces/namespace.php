<?php

/*
 * Namespace / use  --keyword
 *
 * **
 * If you have two classes with the same name , PHP would not know which is being refered
 * To solve this issue , php allows us to use namespace 'keyword'
 * namespace acts as paths in filesystem
 * each section of the namespace is separated by \ (backslash)
 *
 *
 * **
 * Before we use namespaces on thing to note is that
 * even though namespace and the file path will usually be the same
 * this is not necessary, as a developer you can enforce the namespace
