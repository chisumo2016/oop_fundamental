/**
 *Polymorphism
 *
 * Polymorphism is an OOP features that allows us to work with different classes that implemenmts the same interfaceeg
 * eg class  Basic extends Person  implements  Customer and Permium
 *
 *
 *Imagine that we have a function that, given  a payer , checks whether  it is exempt of taxes or not and makes it pay  amount of money
 *
 * This piece of code does not really mind if the payer is a customer , a Librarian m or someiione who has nothing to do with bookstore
